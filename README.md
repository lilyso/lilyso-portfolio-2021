## Project Status

This project is in its first draft. More pages are required to link to the work tiles. "Work" tiles currently contain a placeholder link to a website the author contributes to. 

## Room for Improvement

The website requires separate pages for examples of work & experience as listed in the "Work" section. An addition of a blog page would offer more insight into the author's work history and projects. 

To do:

- Page needs to be created to link to "photography" with examples or gallery.
- Page needs to be created to link to "copywriting" with examples/links.
- Pages needs to be created to link to content strategy and digital marketing sevices.
- Social icons need to be linked to business pages. 
- More tiles to be added to show more development work.
- Blog to be added.
- Page created to showcase web development skills and experience.
